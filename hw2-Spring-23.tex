\item
Consider the following Kripke structure, with $p\in L(s_0) \cap L(s_2)$ and
$q\in L(s_2)$.
\begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle,thick,draw}]
    \node (s0) at (0,0) {$s_0$};
    \node (s1) at (2,0) {$s_1$};
    \node (s2) at (4,0) {$s_2$};
\end{scope}

\begin{scope}[>={Stealth[black]},
              every node/.style={fill=white,circle},
              every edge/.style={draw=black,very thick}]
    \path [->] (s0) edge[bend left=30] (s1);
    \path [->] (s1) edge[bend left=30] (s0);
    \path [->] (s1) edge[bend left=30] (s2);
    \path [->] (s2) edge[bend left=30] (s1);
    \path [->] (s2) edge[loop above] (s2);

\end{center}
Identify the set of states that satisfy each of the following and justify your answer:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\ag{p} =\{ \}$
\item $\af{p}= \{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$
\item $\ag{\af{p}} = \{s_0, s_1, s_2\}$
\item $\af{\ag{p}} = \{ \}$  
\end{enumerate}
\hfill(2+2+3+3 pts)

\item Express the following statements as CTL formula:
\begin{enumerate}

\item
  There exists an execution sequence such that from every configuration in the sequence,
  it is possible to eventually satisfy the property $p$.
  
\textbf{Answer}: $\eg{\ef{p}}$
\item
  Along all paths, whenever $p$ is true, it is followed by a state where $p$ is false, and
  whenever $p$ is false, it is followed by a state where $p$ is true.
  
\textbf{Answer}:  $\ag{(p\rightarrow \ax{\neg p}) \land (\neg p \rightarrow \ax{p})}$
\end{enumerate}
\hfill (4+4 pts)

\item Prove or disprove the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    If a state satisfies $\af{\ag{p}}$ then along all paths from that state the property $p$
    holds infinitely often.

    \textbf{Answer}: Let's assume, $$s_0 \in [[\af{\ag{p}}]]$$

    $$ \Rightarrow \forall \pi \in Path(s_0). \exists i \geq 0 \; \pi(i) \in [[\ag{p}]]$$
    $$ \Rightarrow \forall \pi \in Path(s_0). \exists i \geq 0 \; \pi(i) [ \forall \pi^\prime \in Path(\pi(i))\; \forall j >=i \; \pi^\prime(j) \in [[p]] ]$$
   This simplification tells that in all evaluations starting from the initial state, there exists a state from where $p$ holds in all paths globally. However, the question asks whether this CTL formula satisfies $p$
    holds infinitely often. Since $p$ holds globally in all paths, $\af{\ag{p}}$ disproves the property $p$
    holds infinitely often. 

    \item
    If a state satisfies $\af{\ag{p}}$ then along all paths from that state the property $\neg p$
    holds finitely many times. 
            
\textbf{Answer}: It is immediate from the previous question's explanation that, $\af{\ag{p}}$ does not hold $\neg p$ finitely many times, because the value of $i$ might be anything greater than 0. If $i$ becomes 0,  $\ag{p}$ holds from the initial state. Therefore, $\af{\ag{p}}$ does not ensure $\neg p$ holds finitely many times. 

  \item  If a state satisfies $\eg{\ef{p}}$ then there exists at least one path starting from that
    state where $p$ holds infinitely often.
    
\textbf{Answer}:
Let's assume, $$s_0 \in [[\eg{\ef{p}}]]$$

$$ \Rightarrow \exists \pi \in Path(s_0) \forall i \geq 0 \; \pi(i) \in [[\ef{p} ]]$$
$$\Rightarrow \exists \pi \in Path(s_0) \forall i \geq 0 \; \pi(i) [ \exists \pi^\prime \in Path(\pi(i)) \exists j \geq i \; \pi^\prime(j) \in [[p]]]$$

This implies that there exists a path that satisfies $p$ infinitely often. 
  
  \item $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$ is equivalent to $p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}}$

  \textbf{Answer}: Let's simplify  $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$ and $p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}}$ first. 

  We know $\au{\varphi}{\psi}$ can be written as $\psi \lor (\varphi \land \ax{\au{\varphi}{\psi}})$. So, we can write, $\au{p}{\ax{q}} \Leftrightarrow \ax{q} \lor (p \land \ax{\au{p}{\ax{q}}})$. We can claim a state $s$ satisfies $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$ if it satisfies either $\ax{q}$ or $p \land \ax{\au{p}{\ax{q}}}$. 
  
  
  % For the sake of simplicity, let's assume, $s$ only satisfies $\ax{q}$. We can write it as 
  % $$\forall s, s\in [[\ax{q}]] \Leftrightarrow \forall \pi \in Path(s): \pi(1) \in [[q]]$$

    Similarly, $$p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}} \Leftrightarrow p \land \ax{q \lor (p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}})}$$
   
    % Now let's assume $q$ is satisfied from $q \lor (p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}})$. Then we can write 

    % $$p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}} \Leftrightarrow p \land \ax{q}$$
    
    % We can further write it as follows-

    %   $$\forall s, s\in [[p \land \ax{q}]] \Leftrightarrow \forall \pi \in Path(s): \pi(0) \in [[p]] \land \pi(0) \in [[\ax{q}]]$$

Now, construct a Kripke structure satisfying $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$. 


  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}[every node/.style={circle,thick,draw}]
    \node (s0) at (0,0) {$s_0$};
    \node (s1) at (-1,-1) {$s_1$};
    \node (s2) at (1,-1) {$s_2$};
\end{scope}

\begin{scope}[>={Stealth[black]},
              every node/.style={fill=white,circle},
              every edge/.style={draw=black,very thick}]
    \path [->] (s0) edge (s1);
    \path [->] (s0) edge  (s2);
    \path [->] (s1) edge[loop below] (s1);
    \path [->] (s2) edge[loop below] (s2);
\end{scope}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  &
  %%
  \begin{tabular}{l}
    $L(s_1) = \{q\}$, $L(s_2) = \{q\}$
    \end{tabular}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

From the above simplification, we know the above Kripke structure satisfies $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$ because it holds $\ax{q}$. However, it does not satisfy $p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}}$ because it requires $p$ to be true at the initial state.  
  
Therefore, we can say that $\au{p}{\ax{q}}$ is not equivalent to $p \land \ax{\au{p}{q}}$.

    
  \item \emph{For 512. Extra credit for 412 students}
    The property, \emph{for all paths of the form $\pi$, $p$ is true in every $\pi[i]$ where $i$ is even},
    can be expressed in CTL.
    
    \textbf{Answer}: Let's consider a infinite path $\pi = s_0, s_1, s_2, ..., s_n, s_{n+1}, ... s_{n+k}, ...$. 

    Here $\pi[i] \in [[p]]$ when $i=\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... \}$, and all the odd position $\pi[i] \in [[ \neg p]]$ where $i = \{ 1,3,5,7, ...\}$. 

    The traces of the paths, $traces(\pi)= \{p, \neg p, p, \neg p, p, \neg p, ... \}$. As all the paths follow the same forms, we can say that $p$ is repeated infinitely often. Therefore, we can write it as $\ag{\af{p}}$, which is a valid CTL formula.
